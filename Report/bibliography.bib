	abstract = {We propose a simple method to extract the community structure of large networks. Our
method is a heuristic method that is based on modularity optimization. It is shown to
outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time.
Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the
so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian
mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million
nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad
hoc modular networks.}
